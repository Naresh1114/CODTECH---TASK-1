Objectives
Provide Basic Arithmetic Functions: Enable users to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
User Interaction: Create a simple interface that prompts users for input and displays results.
Error Handling: Implement basic error handling for invalid operations and division by zero.

Key Activities
Define Functions: Create functions for each arithmetic operation.
User Input: Use input() to gather numbers and the desired operation from the user.
Perform Calculations: Based on user input, call the appropriate function and compute the result.
Display Results: Output the result to the user in a readable format.
Error Checking: Implement checks for invalid input and handle exceptions gracefully.

Technologies Used
Python Programming Language: The primary language used for developing the calculator.
Basic Command Line Interface (CLI): The calculator operates through a text-based interface using standard input/output.

Key Insights
Simplicity is Key: A simple interface enhances user experience and makes it easy for anyone to use.
Error Handling is Crucial: Proper handling of edge cases (like division by zero) prevents crashes and improves reliability.
Modular Design: Breaking down functionality into functions allows for easier maintenance and potential future enhancements (like adding more operations).
User Engagement: Interactive prompts make the program engaging and user-friendly.
